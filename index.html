            <li>Rapid production of HeLa cells allow for much medical breakthrough, including the first Polio Vaccine developed by Jonas Salk</li>
            <li>Cells were mailed around the globe into research in field such as Cancer, AIDS, radiation and toxic substances, genes mapping</li>
            <li>Almost around <strong>11,000 Patents</strong> in HeLa Cells</li>
